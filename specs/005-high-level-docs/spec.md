# Feature Specification: High-Level Documentation

**Feature Branch**: `005-high-level-docs`
**Created**: 2025-10-23
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "please add to docs/ md files high level documention that is concise"

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - Quick Start Guide (Priority: P1)

New users or contributors need to quickly understand what autospec is, how it works, and how to get started using it without diving into detailed implementation docs.

**Why this priority**: First impression matters - users abandon projects if they can't understand the basics within 5 minutes. This is the most critical documentation for adoption.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by giving the documentation to someone unfamiliar with the project and measuring if they can install and run their first workflow within 10 minutes.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a new user visits the docs/ directory, **When** they read the overview document, **Then** they understand the project purpose, key features, and primary use cases within 3 minutes
2. **Given** a developer wants to start using the tool, **When** they follow the quick start guide, **Then** they successfully complete their first workflow (specify → plan → tasks) within 10 minutes
3. **Given** a user reads the quick start, **When** they encounter common questions, **Then** the FAQ section addresses their concerns without requiring them to read detailed documentation

---

### User Story 2 - Architecture Overview (Priority: P2)

Contributors and advanced users need to understand the system architecture, component relationships, and design decisions to effectively contribute or troubleshoot issues.

**Why this priority**: Enables contribution and advanced usage, but not required for basic usage. Essential for maintainability and onboarding contributors.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by asking a developer to locate and modify a specific component (e.g., "add a new validation function") and measuring if they can find the right location using only the architecture docs.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a contributor wants to add a new CLI command, **When** they read the architecture overview, **Then** they understand which packages to modify and the execution flow
2. **Given** a user encounters an error, **When** they consult the architecture docs, **Then** they understand which component is responsible and where to look for logs
3. **Given** a developer reviews the architecture diagram, **When** they trace a workflow execution path, **Then** they can identify all involved components and their interactions

---

### User Story 3 - Workflow Reference (Priority: P3)

Users executing complex workflows need quick reference documentation for command options, configuration settings, and common patterns without reading the full specification.

**Why this priority**: Improves efficiency for existing users but not blocking for initial adoption. Users can learn incrementally through trial and error if needed.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by asking a user to execute a specific advanced workflow (e.g., "run implement with custom timeout and retry settings") using only the reference docs.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a user wants to customize workflow behavior, **When** they check the configuration reference, **Then** they find all available settings with clear descriptions and examples
2. **Given** a user encounters a workflow failure, **When** they consult the troubleshooting guide, **Then** they find guidance on interpreting exit codes and retry behavior
3. **Given** a user wants to integrate with CI/CD, **When** they read the workflow reference, **Then** they understand how to chain commands and handle errors programmatically

### Edge Cases

- What happens when documentation files conflict with existing CLAUDE.md or README.md content?
- How does documentation stay synchronized when code architecture changes?
- What if users need documentation in formats other than markdown (PDF, HTML)?
- How do we handle versioning of documentation for different release versions?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: Documentation MUST provide a clear project overview including purpose, key features, and target audience
- **FR-002**: Documentation MUST include a quick start guide covering installation, basic usage, and first workflow execution
- **FR-003**: Documentation MUST describe the system architecture with component diagrams showing relationships between CLI, workflow orchestration, configuration, validation, and retry management
- **FR-004**: Documentation MUST include command reference covering all CLI commands with options, arguments, and usage examples
- **FR-005**: Documentation MUST provide configuration reference listing all settings with descriptions, defaults, and examples
- **FR-006**: Documentation MUST include troubleshooting guide covering common errors, exit codes, and resolution steps
- **FR-007**: Documentation MUST be organized in logical files (e.g., overview.md, quickstart.md, architecture.md, reference.md) for easy navigation
- **FR-008**: Documentation MUST use clear, concise language avoiding unnecessary technical jargon while remaining accurate
- **FR-009**: Documentation MUST include visual diagrams for architecture and workflow execution flows
- **FR-010**: Documentation MUST stay under 500 lines per file to maintain "high-level" focus

### Key Entities

- **Documentation File**: A markdown file in docs/ directory containing specific topic coverage (overview, quickstart, architecture, reference, troubleshooting)
- **Documentation Section**: A logical grouping within a documentation file (e.g., "Installation", "Commands", "Configuration")
- **Code Reference**: Links from documentation to specific code locations (file:line format) for readers who want deeper details
- **Diagram**: Visual representation of architecture or workflows embedded in documentation

## Success Criteria *(mandatory)*

### Measurable Outcomes

- **SC-001**: New users can understand project purpose and complete first workflow within 10 minutes of reading documentation
- **SC-002**: Contributors can locate and modify code components within 5 minutes using architecture documentation
- **SC-003**: 90% of common user questions are answered by FAQ or troubleshooting sections without needing to ask maintainers
- **SC-004**: Documentation coverage includes all CLI commands and configuration options with no gaps
- **SC-005**: Each documentation file remains under 500 lines to ensure conciseness and readability
- **SC-006**: Users rate documentation clarity as 4/5 or higher when surveyed after first use

## Assumptions

- Users prefer markdown documentation over other formats (HTML, PDF) for developer tools
- Documentation will be maintained in sync with code through manual review process (no automated sync)
- Visual diagrams can be created using mermaid syntax or simple ASCII art embedded in markdown
- English is the primary language for documentation (no internationalization required initially)
- Documentation will be version-controlled alongside code in the same repository
- Existing CLAUDE.md serves implementation/contributor audience while new docs/ serves user audience
- The docs/ directory doesn't currently exist and needs to be created
- Documentation should complement rather than duplicate existing CLAUDE.md content

## Scope

### In Scope

- Creating docs/ directory structure
- Writing overview.md (project purpose, features, audience)
- Writing quickstart.md (installation, basic usage, first workflow)
- Writing architecture.md (component overview, diagrams, execution flows)
- Writing reference.md (commands, configuration, exit codes)
- Writing troubleshooting.md (common errors, solutions, debugging tips)
- Creating architectural diagrams using mermaid or ASCII art
- Cross-referencing between documentation files
- Linking to relevant code locations using file:line format

### Out of Scope

- Detailed API documentation (covered in code comments and godoc)
- Tutorial-style guides for every possible use case (quick start only)
- Video or interactive documentation
- Documentation website or hosting (just markdown files)
- Automated documentation generation from code
- Internationalization or translation
- Modifying existing CLAUDE.md or README.md significantly
- Creating separate documentation for legacy bash scripts (being phased out)

## Dependencies

- Existing CLAUDE.md content to avoid duplication
- Current CLI command structure and options from internal/cli/
- Architecture details from codebase (internal/ packages)
- Configuration schema from internal/config/
- Exit code conventions from existing implementation

## Non-Functional Requirements

- **Readability**: Documentation written at 8th-grade reading level for accessibility
- **Maintainability**: Each file covers single topic to simplify updates
- **Discoverability**: Clear table of contents and cross-references between documents
- **Consistency**: Uniform formatting, heading structure, and code example style across all files
- **Brevity**: Each document focuses on essential information only, avoiding verbose explanations
