# 2. user_stories
user_stories:
  - id: US-001
    title: Configure cclean options internally
    priority: P1
    as_a: Developer
    i_want: To configure cclean options internally within the application
    so_that: I can customize the behavior of cclean without modifying the command-line interface
    why_this_priority: Internal configuration provides flexibility and maintainability for cclean usage
    independent_test: Verify that cclean options can be set and modified through internal configuration without affecting the command-line interface
    acceptance_scenarios:
      - given: Default cclean configuration is set
        when: A developer changes the configuration internally
        then: The cclean behavior reflects the updated configuration
  - id: US-002
    title: View cclean arguments
    priority: P2
    as_a: Developer
    i_want: To view the supported arguments for cclean version 0.2.0
    so_that: I can understand the available options and their usage
    why_this_priority: Knowing the supported arguments helps in configuring cclean effectively
    independent_test: Verify that the list of supported arguments for cclean version 0.2.0 is accessible and accurate
    acceptance_scenarios:
      - given: The developer needs to configure cclean
        when: The developer views the supported arguments
        then: The list of arguments is displayed correctly

# 3. requirements
requirements:
  functional:
    - id: FR-001
      description: MUST provide internal configuration options for cclean
      testable: true
      acceptance_criteria: The application must allow developers to configure cclean options internally
    - id: FR-002
      description: MUST display supported arguments for cclean version 0.2.0
      testable: true
      acceptance_criteria: The application must show the list of supported arguments when requested
  non_functional:
    - id: NFR-001
      category: usability
      description: The configuration interface should be intuitive and easy to use
      measurable_target: Developers should be able to configure cclean options without referring to documentation

# 4. success_criteria
success_criteria:
  measurable_outcomes:
    - id: SC-001
      description: Developers can configure cclean options internally without modifying the command-line interface
      metric: Number of configuration options successfully set internally
      target: 100% of options configurable internally
    - id: SC-002
      description: The list of supported arguments for cclean version 0.2.0 is accurate and accessible
      metric: Accuracy of the displayed arguments
      target: 100% accuracy

# 5. key_entities
key_entities:
  - name: cclean configuration
    description: The set of configurable options for cclean
    attributes:
      - Option name
      - Option value
      - Description

# 6. edge_cases
edge_cases:
  - scenario: No configuration options are set
    expected_behavior: The default behavior of cclean should be applied
  - scenario: Invalid configuration options are provided
    expected_behavior: The system should handle invalid options gracefully and provide an error message

# 7. assumptions

# 9. out_of_scope
out_of_scope:
  - Modifications to the cclean command-line interface
  - Configuration options that are not supported by cclean version 0.2.0
