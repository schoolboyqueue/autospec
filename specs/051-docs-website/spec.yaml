    input: "improve the generated github CI web page to have a cool modern website rather than just the readme - with quickstart, more pages easy , page navigation, code examples. etc... all relevant docs/* should be integrated too in a concise way - additionally the go binary must not include those web pages - keep it seperate in this repo but not compiled into the binary"

      expected_behavior: "Page loads with full navigation context; user can navigate to other sections"
    - scenario: "User views site on very narrow mobile screen"
      expected_behavior: "Content remains readable; navigation collapses to hamburger menu"

      expected_behavior: "Website rebuilds automatically on push to main branch"
    - scenario: "User clicks a broken internal link"
      expected_behavior: "Jekyll build fails on broken links, preventing deployment"
assumptions:
    - "Existing Jekyll configuration in docs/_config.yml is the foundation (not replacing with a different SSG)"
    - "GitHub Pages with Jekyll is sufficient for the website requirements (no need for custom build)"
    - "The existing cayman theme can be customized or replaced with a more modern theme"
    - "Website deployment continues via existing GitHub Actions CI workflow"
    - "No authentication or user accounts required for documentation access"
    - "Existing markdown content in docs/* can be reorganized without breaking external links (redirects if needed)"
constraints:
    - "Must use Jekyll (already configured) or another GitHub Pages-compatible static site generator"
    - "Cannot require server-side processing - static files only"
    - "Website source files must be in site/ directory, NOT in internal/ or other Go package directories"
    - "GitHub Pages deployment via GitHub Actions can build from any directory"
    - "Cannot add build-time dependencies that increase CI time significantly (> 2 minutes)"
    - "Must maintain existing URL structure where possible to avoid breaking external links"
    - "MUST NOT embed large images or videos in the repository - only external URLs allowed for media assets"
    - "docs/ directory is for markdown documentation source files, not website build assets"
