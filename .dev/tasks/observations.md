# Claude Autospec Session Observations

Analysis of autospec-triggered Claude conversations to identify improvement opportunities for `/internal/commands/*.md` templates, schemas, and workflow efficiency.

---

## Feedback Framework

This document is part of the autospec feedback system:

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `.dev/tasks/observations.md` | Central observations document (this file) |
| `.dev/feedback/reviewed.txt` | Registry of analyzed conversation IDs |
| `scripts/parse-claude-conversation.sh` | CLI helper for parsing conversations |
| `.claude/commands/feedback.md` | Slash command for guided analysis |

### Quick Start

```bash
# Find unreviewed conversations
./scripts/parse-claude-conversation.sh unreviewed

# Analyze a specific conversation
./scripts/parse-claude-conversation.sh issues ~/.claude/projects/-home-ari-repos-autospec/<id>.jsonl

# Mark as reviewed after analysis
./scripts/parse-claude-conversation.sh mark <short_id> <command_type>
```

### Using the Slash Command

```
/feedback              # Show next unreviewed conversation
/feedback status       # Show review progress
/feedback <id>         # Analyze specific conversation
/feedback patterns     # Cross-session pattern analysis
```

## Methodology: How to Parse Claude Conversations

### Conversation File Location

Claude Code stores conversation history as JSONL files in project-specific directories:

```
~/.claude/projects/-home-ari-repos-autospec/*.jsonl
```

The path format is: `~/.claude/projects/<escaped-project-path>/`
- Project path `/home/ari/repos/autospec` becomes `-home-ari-repos-autospec`
- Each conversation is a UUID-named `.jsonl` file

### Listing Conversations by Date

```bash
# List all conversations sorted by modification time (most recent first)
ls -lt ~/.claude/projects/-home-ari-repos-autospec/*.jsonl | head -30
```

### Identifying Autospec-Triggered Conversations

Autospec commands inject `/autospec.*` slash commands at the start of sessions. Filter for these:

```bash
# Find files containing autospec commands
cd ~/.claude/projects/-home-ari-repos-autospec
for f in *.jsonl; do
  if grep -q '/autospec\.' "$f" 2>/dev/null; then
    echo "$f"
  fi
done

# Combined: list autospec files sorted by date
ls -lt *.jsonl | while read line; do
  f=$(echo "$line" | awk '{print $NF}')
  if grep -q '/autospec\.' "$f" 2>/dev/null; then
    echo "$line"
  fi
done | head -20
```

### Identifying Which Autospec Command Was Used

```bash
# Extract the specific autospec command from each file
for f in *.jsonl; do
  echo "=== $f ==="
  grep -o '/autospec\.[a-z]*' "$f" | head -1
done
```

Common patterns:
- `/autospec.specify` - Feature specification generation
- `/autospec.plan` - Implementation plan generation
- `/autospec.tasks` - Task breakdown generation
- `/autospec.implement` - Implementation execution (most common)

### Parsing with cclean

`cclean` transforms Claude's stream-json output into readable terminal output.

```bash
# Basic usage - parse a conversation file
cclean output.jsonl

# Plain text output (best for analysis/piping)
cclean -s plain output.jsonl

# Show first N lines of parsed output
cclean -s plain output.jsonl | head -500

# Available styles:
#   default  - Full output with colored boxes and borders
#   compact  - Single-line summaries for each message
#   minimal  - Clean output without box-drawing characters
#   plain    - No colors, suitable for piping and analysis

# Verbose output (includes usage stats, tool IDs)
cclean -V output.jsonl

# With line numbers
cclean -n output.jsonl
```

### Example Analysis Workflow

```bash
# 1. Find the 10 most recent autospec implement sessions
cd ~/.claude/projects/-home-ari-repos-autospec
ls -lt *.jsonl | while read line; do
  f=$(echo "$line" | awk '{print $NF}')
  if grep -q '/autospec\.implement' "$f" 2>/dev/null; then
    echo "$line"
  fi
done | head -10

# 2. Parse a specific conversation
cclean -s plain 548be630-e88b-473c-82d1-d4334e3bb5a3.jsonl | head -800

# 3. Search for specific patterns in parsed output
cclean -s plain file.jsonl | grep -E "(TOOL:|Read|Grep|workflow_test)"

# 4. Count tool usage in a session
cclean -s plain file.jsonl | grep "^TOOL:" | sort | uniq -c | sort -rn
```

### Key Identifiers in Parsed Output

When analyzing parsed conversations, look for:

| Pattern | Meaning |
|---------|---------|
| `TOOL: Read` | File read operation |
| `TOOL: Bash` | Shell command execution |
| `TOOL: Grep` | Content search |
| `TOOL: Write` | File creation/modification |
| `TOOL: mcp__serena__*` | Serena MCP tool calls |
| `TOOL RESULT` | Output from tool execution |
| `TOOL RESULT ERROR` | Failed tool execution |
| `ASSISTANT` | Claude's response text |
| `/autospec.*` | Autospec command invocation |

### Identifying Inefficiencies

Look for these patterns indicating wasted context:

```bash
# Files read multiple times
cclean -s plain file.jsonl | grep "file_path:" | sort | uniq -c | sort -rn | head -20

# Large file read errors
cclean -s plain file.jsonl | grep -i "exceeds maximum"

# Serena MCP failures
cclean -s plain file.jsonl | grep -i "language server.*not initialized"

# Checklists directory checks
cclean -s plain file.jsonl | grep -i "checklists"

# Sandbox failures
cclean -s plain file.jsonl | grep -i "dangerouslyDisableSandbox"
```

## Per-Conversation Analysis

### File: 548be630 (implement - cli-test-coverage)
**Command:** `/autospec.implement`
**Issues:**
- Claude read entire `implement.go` (253 lines) when only specific functions were needed
- Serena MCP server initialization errors caused fallback to standard tools
- Read `workflow.go` (1257 lines) - file too large, had to use grep
- Re-read test files that were already in context from phase context file
- Multiple build attempts due to sandbox restrictions on go cache

**Recommendations:**
- Add function-level context hints in `plan.yaml` for targeted reading
- Pre-cache common codebase patterns in spec notes

---

### File: e63ee60b (implement - workflow-mock-coverage Phase 6)
**Command:** `/autospec.implement`
**Issues:**
- Phase context file already contains bundled spec/plan/tasks, yet Claude reads individual files
- Checked for `checklists/` directory (doesn't exist) - unnecessary check
- `workflow_test.go` (45K+ tokens) exceeded read limit, had to use offset/limit
- Multiple coverage checks for same function
- Already at 85.9% coverage but still reading T015-T018 as pending

**Recommendations:**
- Add `has_checklists: false` flag to phase context to skip check
- Split large test files or document reading strategy in spec notes
- Phase context should indicate current coverage status

---

### File: 45fc0f1a (implement - workflow-mock-coverage Phase 5)
**Command:** `/autospec.implement`
**Issues:**
- Same pattern: reads phase context then reads spec.yaml/tasks.yaml individually
- Serena MCP errors causing fallback to standard tools
- `go build` failed in sandbox, required `dangerouslyDisableSandbox: true`
- Had to discover `mock-claude.sh` location again (already known from previous phases)

**Recommendations:**
- Cache test infrastructure paths in spec-level `notes.yaml`
- Default sandbox exception for `go build` commands
- Serena integration needs stability improvements

---

### File: fa89d6fc (implement - workflow-mock-coverage Phase 4)
**Command:** `/autospec.implement`
**Issues:**
- Redundant reads: phase-4.yaml → tasks.yaml → spec.yaml
- Checked for non-existent `checklists/` directory
- `preflight.go` and `preflight_test.go` read multiple times
- Sandbox restriction workaround for go build

**Recommendations:**
- Phase context file should be self-sufficient for context needs
- Consider adding "relevant files" hints to task definitions

---

### File: a72ad561 (implement - workflow-mock-coverage Phase 3)
**Command:** `/autospec.implement`
**Issues:**
- Serena MCP "language server not initialized" errors
- Had to fallback to standard Read/Grep tools
- `workflow_test.go` file too large (45K tokens) to read
- Re-discovered `newTestOrchestratorWithSpecName`, `MockClaudeExecutor` patterns

**Recommendations:**
- Document test infrastructure patterns in `.autospec/memory/` for reuse
- Consider file splitting for large test files

---

### File: 927c4e6e (implement - workflow-mock-coverage Phase 2)
**Command:** `/autospec.implement`
**Issues:**
- Read phase-2.yaml context, then read tasks.yaml separately
- Mock infrastructure verification required reading multiple files
- `mock-claude.sh` location discovery (tests/mocks/ vs mocks/scripts/)

**Recommendations:**
- Standardize mock script location, document in constitution
- Phase context should include mock infrastructure paths

---

### File: f3ff2c5a (implement - workflow-mock-coverage Phase 1)
**Command:** `/autospec.implement`
**Issues:**
- Baseline coverage verification reads many files
- Had to discover and verify mock infrastructure from scratch
- Multiple grep searches to find 0% coverage functions
- `go test -cover` output needed multiple parses

**Recommendations:**
- Setup phase should produce a `phase-1-context.yaml` with discovered infrastructure
- Coverage baseline could be cached in spec artifacts

---

### File: 4a60cc8d (specify - cli-test-coverage)
**Command:** `/autospec.specify`
**Issues:**
- Created new feature branch but git remote warnings
- Spec generation proceeded normally
- No major inefficiencies observed

**Recommendations:**
- Suppress expected git remote warnings during new-feature

---

### File: a8264752 (implement session)
**Command:** `/autospec.implement`
**Issues:**
- Similar patterns to other implement sessions
- Phase context → individual file reads redundancy
- Test infrastructure rediscovery

---

### File: 17d2ab22 (current conversation - analysis)
**Command:** Various (analysis task)
**Issues:**
- N/A - this is the analysis conversation itself

---

## Proposed Improvements

### 1. **Add `notes.yaml` Per-Spec Artifact**

Create a new artifact type `notes.yaml` that stores spec-specific context:

```yaml
# specs/043-workflow-mock-coverage/notes.yaml
discovered_context:
  test_infrastructure:
    mock_claude_path: "mocks/scripts/mock-claude.sh"
    test_helper: "newTestOrchestratorWithSpecName()"
    mock_executor: "MockClaudeExecutor in mocks_test.go"
  large_files:
    - path: "internal/workflow/workflow_test.go"
      strategy: "Use grep for function lookup, read sections with offset/limit"
      functions_of_interest:
        - name: "newTestOrchestratorWithSpecName"
          line: 3296
        - name: "writeTestTasks"
          line: 3448
  coverage_baseline: 79.4%
  functions_targeting:
    zero_coverage:
      - "PromptUserToContinue:preflight.go:117"
      - "runPreflightChecks:workflow.go:217"
    low_coverage:
      - "executeTaskLoop:workflow.go:822:55.6%"
has_checklists: false
```

**Benefits:**
- Eliminates rediscovery across phases
- Provides reading strategy for large files
- Cached infrastructure paths

### 2. **Enhance Phase Context File**

Add metadata to `.autospec/context/phase-X.yaml`:

```yaml
# Additional fields
_context_meta:
  has_checklists: false
  skip_individual_artifact_reads: true  # Context is self-sufficient
  coverage_baseline: "79.4%"
  coverage_target: "85%"
  test_infrastructure:
    mock_path: "mocks/scripts/mock-claude.sh"
    mock_executor: "internal/workflow/mocks_test.go"
```

### 3. **Update implement.md Command Template**

Add guidance to `/internal/commands/implement.md`:

```markdown
## Context Reading Strategy

1. **Phase context file is authoritative** - contains bundled spec, plan, and phase tasks
2. **Skip individual artifact reads** unless phase context indicates otherwise
3. **Check `notes.yaml`** if present for cached infrastructure context
4. **For large files (>1000 lines):**
   - Use Grep to locate specific functions
   - Use Read with offset/limit for targeted sections
   - Document reading strategy in spec notes for future phases
```

### 4. **Add Sandbox Exception for Go Build**

Update `.claude/settings.local.json` or recommend in `CLAUDE.md`:

```json
{
  "permissions": {
    "allow": [
      "Bash(go build:*)",
      "Bash(go test:*)",
      "Bash(make build:*)"
    ]
  }
}
```

### 5. **Schema Changes for tasks.yaml**

Add optional metadata fields:

```yaml
tasks:
  # ... existing fields ...
  _implementation_hints:
    test_infrastructure:
      mock_command: "path/to/mock-claude.sh"
      test_helper: "functionName in file.go"
    large_file_strategy:
      - file: "internal/workflow/workflow_test.go"
        approach: "grep for function names, read sections"
    prerequisite_checks:
      has_checklists: false
```

### 6. **Improve Checklists Check**

In `implement` workflow, cache the checklists check result:

```go
// After first check, store in phase context
if !hasChecklists {
    phaseContext.Meta.HasChecklists = false
    // Future phases skip the check
}
```

### 7. **Serena MCP Stability**

> **Note:** These issues appear to be fixed as of late December 2025.

While external to autospec, previously recommended:
- Add retry logic for Serena initialization failures
- Log Serena errors to help debugging
- Document fallback behavior in CLAUDE.md

---

## Implementation Priority

| Improvement | Priority | Effort | Impact |
|-------------|----------|--------|--------|
| Add notes.yaml artifact | High | Medium | High |
| Enhance phase context | High | Low | High |
| Update implement.md template | High | Low | Medium |
| Add sandbox exceptions | Medium | Low | Medium |
| Schema changes for tasks.yaml | Medium | Medium | Medium |
| Improve checklists check | Low | Low | Low |
| Serena stability (external) | Low | N/A | Medium | ✅ Likely fixed |

---

## Metrics for Success

After implementing improvements:
- **Context tokens reduced**: Target 30-50% reduction in redundant reads
- **Phase startup time**: Reduced file discovery overhead
- **Error rate**: Fewer sandbox/MCP fallback errors
- **Cross-phase continuity**: Information persists between phases without rediscovery

# Additional Analysis: Second Batch of 10 Conversations

**Analysis Date:** 2025-12-17 (continued)
**Additional Conversations:** 10 more autospec sessions
**Features Covered:** 040-workflow-mock-coverage (Phases 1-5), 043-workflow-mock-coverage tasks/plan/specify

---

## Additional Per-Conversation Analysis

### File: 0f095c33 (tasks - 043-workflow-mock-coverage)
**Command:** `/autospec.tasks`
**Issues:**
- Read spec.yaml and plan.yaml individually even though prereqs output included paths
- Generated tasks.yaml successfully but had to validate with separate command
- No issues with task generation itself

**Recommendations:**
- Tasks generation is efficient, no major changes needed

---

### File: e37bcc21 (plan - 043-workflow-mock-coverage)
**Command:** `/autospec.plan`
**Issues:**
- Read spec.yaml and constitution.yaml - both necessary for plan generation
- Serena MCP "language server not initialized" error
- Ran `go test -cover` and `go tool cover -func` to discover coverage data
- Multiple grep searches to locate function signatures
- Coverage data rediscovered (same functions as in 040 sessions)

**Recommendations:**
- If spec already contains coverage analysis (from `autospec.specify`), plan command shouldn't need to re-run coverage analysis
- Consider caching coverage baseline in spec.yaml non_functional requirements

---

### File: eba73b63 (specify - 043-workflow-mock-coverage)
**Command:** `/autospec.specify`
**Issues:**
- `new-feature` command produced git remote warnings (expected)
- Spec generation proceeded normally
- No redundant file reads observed

**Recommendations:**
- Specify workflow is efficient

---

### File: 83808fcf (implement - 040-workflow-mock-coverage analysis)
**Command:** `/autospec.implement` (likely a coverage analysis task)
**Issues:**
- Multiple Serena MCP tool errors with parameter validation (`name_path_pattern` missing)
- Fell back to Grep tool for function discovery
- Same coverage functions discovered as previous sessions
- TodoWrite used effectively for tracking progress

**Recommendations:**
- Serena parameter naming inconsistency (`name_path` vs `name_path_pattern`) causes repeated errors
- Document correct Serena tool parameters in implement.md template

---

### File: 67e52dbb (implement - 040-workflow-mock-coverage Phase 5)
**Command:** `/autospec.implement`
**Issues:**
- Read phase-5.yaml context (463 lines) then still read tasks.yaml separately
- Checked for checklists directory (doesn't exist)
- `workflow_test.go` too large (35K+ tokens) - had to grep for function names
- Serena MCP errors, fell back to standard tools
- Same test helper functions rediscovered: `newTestOrchestratorWithSpecName`, `writeTestSpec`, etc.

**Recommendations:**
- Phase context already includes tasks - template should say "don't read individual artifact files"
- Large file handling strategy should be in implement.md template

---

### File: f0ee6c81 (implement - 040-workflow-mock-coverage Phase 4)
**Command:** `/autospec.implement`
**Issues:**
- Same pattern: reads phase-4.yaml then tasks.yaml separately
- Checked for checklists directory (doesn't exist)
- Serena MCP list_dir worked for checking checklists, then failed later
- Multiple file reads for same content

**Recommendations:**
- Same as Phase 5 - redundant reads after phase context

---

### File: 7b1395e1 (implement - 040-workflow-mock-coverage Phase 3)
**Command:** `/autospec.implement`
**Issues:**
- Read phase-3.yaml context then individual spec/plan/tasks files
- Checklists directory check (doesn't exist)
- `workflow_test.go` too large (33K tokens) - used grep for function names
- Serena MCP errors with all symbolic operations
- Discovered test infrastructure from scratch again

**Recommendations:**
- Mock infrastructure paths should be in phase context
- Template should explicitly state to use phase context as primary source

---

### File: b6a708ed (implement - 040-workflow-mock-coverage Phase 2)
**Command:** `/autospec.implement`
**Issues:**
- Read phase-2.yaml context, then tasks.yaml separately
- Serena list_dir used for checklists check
- Read testutil/mock_executor.go and fixtures to understand existing infrastructure
- Good use of TodoWrite for task tracking

**Recommendations:**
- Phase 2 had efficient execution after initial context loading

---

### File: f2f6064f (implement - 040-workflow-mock-coverage Phase 1)
**Command:** `/autospec.implement`
**Issues:**
- Read phase-1.yaml context, then tasks.yaml separately
- Verified mock-claude.sh script capabilities (MOCK_RESPONSE_FILE, MOCK_CALL_LOG, MOCK_EXIT_CODE)
- Efficient task execution - verified acceptance criteria directly

**Recommendations:**
- Phase 1 (setup) executed efficiently
- Good pattern: verify acceptance criteria directly rather than extensive code reading

---

### File: c2eaa70d (tasks - 040-workflow-mock-coverage)
**Command:** `/autospec.tasks`
**Issues:**
- Read spec.yaml and plan.yaml as required inputs
- Generated comprehensive tasks.yaml with 14 tasks across 5 phases
- Validation passed successfully

**Recommendations:**
- Tasks generation workflow is efficient

---

## Cross-Session Pattern Analysis

### Patterns Repeated Across 20 Sessions

| Pattern | Occurrences | Sessions |
|---------|-------------|----------|
| Checklists directory check for non-existent dir | 15/20 | All implement sessions |
| Phase context → individual artifact reads | 12/20 | All phase implement sessions |
| Serena MCP "language server not initialized" | 10/20 | ~50% of sessions (likely fixed now) |
| workflow_test.go token limit exceeded | 8/20 | Phases 3-6 |
| Test infrastructure rediscovery | 10/20 | All implement sessions |
| Coverage analysis re-run | 4/20 | Plan + some implement sessions |

### Efficiency Observations by Command Type

| Command | Efficiency | Notes |
|---------|------------|-------|
| `/autospec.specify` | High | Minimal redundant reads |
| `/autospec.plan` | Medium | Coverage analysis could be cached from specify |
| `/autospec.tasks` | High | Efficient generation from spec+plan |
| `/autospec.implement` | Low | Heavy redundant reads, infrastructure rediscovery |

---

## Refined Recommendations

### High Priority - Immediate Impact

1. **Update implement.md template** with explicit guidance:
   ```markdown
   ## Context Strategy

   1. The phase context file (`.autospec/context/phase-X.yaml`) is your PRIMARY source
   2. DO NOT read individual spec.yaml, plan.yaml, or tasks.yaml files
   3. The phase context bundles all necessary information
   4. Only read additional files if task acceptance criteria require specific file content
   ```

2. **Add `has_checklists` field to phase context metadata**:
   ```yaml
   _context_meta:
     has_checklists: false  # Skip checklists directory check
   ```

3. **Cache test infrastructure in spec notes**:
   ```yaml
   # Generated after Phase 1 discovery
   _discovered:
     mock_infrastructure:
       mock_claude: "mocks/scripts/mock-claude.sh"
       mock_executor: "internal/workflow/mocks_test.go"
       test_helper: "newTestOrchestratorWithSpecName:workflow_test.go:3296"
   ```

### Medium Priority - Code Changes

4. **Add `large_files` handling strategy to tasks.yaml schema**:
   ```yaml
   tasks:
     _hints:
       large_files:
         - path: "internal/workflow/workflow_test.go"
           size: "45K+ tokens"
           strategy: "grep for function names, use offset/limit"
   ```

5. **Coverage baseline caching in spec.yaml**:
   ```yaml
   feature:
     _metrics:
       coverage_baseline: "79.4%"
       coverage_target: "85%"
       low_coverage_functions:
         - "PromptUserToContinue:0%"
         - "runPreflightChecks:0%"
   ```

### Low Priority - External Dependencies

6. **Serena MCP stability** - ✅ Likely fixed as of late December 2025
   - Previously: "language server manager not initialized" occurred ~50% of sessions
   - Parameter naming inconsistency (`name_path` vs `name_path_pattern`) - may still need attention
   - These observations were from analysis sessions prior to recent MCP updates

---

## Updated Implementation Priority

| Improvement | Priority | Effort | Impact | Status |
|-------------|----------|--------|--------|--------|
| Update implement.md template | **Critical** | Low | High | Not started |
| Add has_checklists to phase context | High | Low | Medium | Not started |
| Cache test infrastructure in notes | High | Medium | High | Not started |
| Add large_files hints to tasks schema | Medium | Medium | Medium | Not started |
| Cache coverage in spec | Medium | Low | Medium | Not started |
| Serena MCP stability | Low | External | Medium | ✅ Likely fixed |

# Additional Analysis: autospec-block-task-reason Project Sessions

**Analysis Date:** 2025-12-17
**Project:** autospec-block-task-reason
**Additional Conversations:** 3 implement sessions from new project fork
**Features Covered:** 041-orchestrator-schema-validation

---

## Per-Conversation Analysis (Block-Task-Reason Fork)

### File: cff29d20 (implement - core-feature-improvements)
**Command:** `/autospec.implement`
**Size:** 1.3M, 200 lines, 48 tool uses
**Issues:**
- Read `.dev/tasks/core-feature-improvements.md` **23 times** (extreme redundancy)
- Read `docs/troubleshooting.md` 2 times
- 6 references to checklists directory (doesn't exist)
- 1 Serena MCP error

**Key Finding:** Same file read 23 times indicates context loss between tool calls or aggressive re-verification. This is a severe inefficiency pattern.

**Recommendations:**
- Template should instruct to cache file contents in working memory
- Consider adding "files_read" tracking to prevent duplicate reads

---

### File: d645bf41 (implement - orchestrator-schema-validation Phase 2)
**Command:** `/autospec.implement`
**Size:** 476K, 150 lines, 57 tool uses
**Issues:**
- Read phase-2.yaml context (contains bundled spec+plan+tasks) then **still read tasks.yaml separately**
- Read `internal/workflow/schema_validation.go` **6 times**
- 14 references to checklists directory (doesn't exist)
- 3 large file handling issues (troubleshooting.md exceeds 960 > 950 line limit)
- 12 sandbox restriction issues requiring workarounds
- 57 individual artifact reads after phase context load
- 1 Serena MCP error

**Pattern Analysis:**
```
1. Read phase-2.yaml (contains full spec, plan, phase tasks)
2. Immediately read tasks.yaml (REDUNDANT - already in phase context)
3. Read schema_validation.go
4. Read various validation files
5. Re-read schema_validation.go (REDUNDANT)
6. Re-read schema_validation.go (REDUNDANT)
... and so on
```

**Recommendations:**
- Template MUST explicitly state: "Phase context is self-sufficient, DO NOT read individual artifacts"
- Add file deduplication guidance: "Do not re-read files you have already read in this session"

---

### File: 7223fd36 (implement - artifact validation tasks)
**Command:** `/autospec.implement`
**Size:** 580K, 154 lines, 57 tool uses
**Issues:**
- Read `artifact_tasks_test.go` 4 times
- Read `artifact.go` 4 times
- Read `artifact_tasks.go` 3 times
- Read `artifact.go` (cli version) 3 times
- 5 references to checklists directory (doesn't exist)
- 15 sandbox restriction issues
- 22 individual artifact reads after phase context

**Pattern:** Files being read multiple times during implementation, likely due to:
1. Initial reading for understanding
2. Re-reading before making edits
3. Re-reading after edits to verify
4. Re-reading when referencing in other files

**Recommendations:**
- Template should suggest maintaining a "session cache" of file contents
- Only re-read files if they have been edited by another process

---

## Cross-Session Pattern Analysis (Block-Task-Reason Fork)

### New Patterns Identified

| Pattern | Sessions | Token Waste |
|---------|----------|-------------|
| Same file read 5+ times | 3/3 | High (~15K per session) |
| Phase context → tasks.yaml read | 3/3 | Medium (~3K per session) |
| Checklists check (non-existent) | 3/3 | Low (~500 per session) |
| Sandbox workarounds | 3/3 | Medium (~2K per session) |
| Serena MCP errors | 2/3 | Medium (~1K per session) |

### Severity Assessment

**CRITICAL: Duplicate File Reads**
- `schema_validation.go` read 6 times in one session
- `.dev/tasks/core-feature-improvements.md` read 23 times in one session
- This pattern wastes **significant context** and can exhaust token limits

### Root Cause Analysis

1. **No Session-Level File Cache**: Claude has no mechanism to remember file contents within a session
2. **Template Doesn't Prevent Re-reads**: implement.md doesn't explicitly discourage re-reading
3. **Verification Anxiety**: Pattern of reading → editing → re-reading → verifying suggests Claude doesn't trust its in-context memory
4. **Checklists Check Not Cached**: Every phase checks for checklists even when none exist

## Updated Recommendations

### Critical Priority (Immediate)

1. **Add File Deduplication Guidance to implement.md**:
   ```markdown
   ## File Reading Strategy

   CRITICAL: Minimize file reads to conserve context tokens.

   1. **Read once, remember**: When you read a file, retain its contents in your working memory
   2. **Don't re-read for verification**: If you just read a file, you already know its contents
   3. **Only re-read if modified externally**: Only re-read files that may have changed outside your control
   4. **Phase context is authoritative**: The phase-X.yaml file contains bundled artifacts - do NOT read spec.yaml, plan.yaml, or tasks.yaml separately
   ```

2. **Add has_checklists to Phase Context Metadata**:
   ```yaml
   _context_meta:
     has_checklists: false
     phase_artifacts_bundled: true  # Indicates spec/plan/tasks are included
   ```

3. **Track Files Read in TodoWrite**:
   Consider adding a `_files_read` section to todos to track what's been loaded:
   ```yaml
   _files_read:
     - path: "internal/workflow/schema_validation.go"
       lines: 145
       at_turn: 3
   ```

### High Priority (Next Sprint)

4. **Sandbox Pre-Approval for Go Commands**:
   Add to `.claude/settings.local.json`:
   ```json
   {
     "permissions": {
       "allow": [
         "Bash(go build:*)",
         "Bash(go test:*)",
         "Bash(GOCACHE=/tmp/claude/go-cache go build:*)",
         "Bash(GOCACHE=/tmp/claude/go-cache go test:*)"
       ]
     }
   }
   ```

5. **Template-Level File Reference Strategy**:
   Add to task definitions in tasks.yaml:
   ```yaml
   _reading_hints:
     primary_files:
       - path: "internal/workflow/schema_validation.go"
         read_strategy: "Read once at task start"
     reference_files:
       - path: "internal/validation/artifact.go"
         read_strategy: "Grep for specific patterns, read sections as needed"
   ```
