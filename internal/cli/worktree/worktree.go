	Short: "Manage git worktrees with project-aware setup",
	Long: `Manage git worktrees with automatic project configuration.

The worktree command helps create and manage git worktrees with automatic
copying of non-tracked directories (.autospec/, .claude/) and execution
of project-specific setup scripts.

This is useful when running multiple autospec workflows in parallel across
different feature branches.`,
