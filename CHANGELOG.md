## [Unreleased]

## [0.6.0] - 2025-12-20

### Changed
- Multi-agent support (in development) now gated to dev builds only; production builds default to Claude Code
- DAG-based parallel execution (in development) gated to dev builds only
- `init` command now collects all user choices before applying changes, with final confirmation before running Claude sessions

### Added
- **[Dev builds only]** DAG-based parallel task execution with `implement --parallel` flag for concurrent task processing
- **[Dev builds only]** `--max-parallel` flag to limit concurrent task execution (default: number of CPU cores)
- **[Dev builds only]** `--worktrees` flag for git worktree-based task isolation during parallel execution
- **[Dev builds only]** `--dry-run` flag to preview execution plan without running tasks
- **[Dev builds only]** `--yes` flag to skip resume confirmation prompts
- **[Dev builds only]** `dag` command to visualize task dependencies as ASCII graph with wave grouping
- **[Dev builds only]** Parallel execution state persistence with resume support (R/W/S/A options: resume, resume wave, skip failed, abort)
- Multi-agent CLI abstraction layer with 6 built-in agents (claude, cline, gemini, codex, opencode, goose) and custom agent support via `agent_preset` config or `--agent` flag
- Structured `custom_agent` config with explicit `command`, `args`, `env`, and `post_processor` fields (replaces error-prone shell string parsing)
- Agent discovery and status in `autospec doctor` showing installed agents with versions
- `view` command to display dashboard overview of all specs with completion status and task progress
- `worktree` command for git worktree management (create, list, remove, setup, prune) with automatic project setup
- `worktree gen-script` command to generate project-specific setup scripts for worktrees
- `init` command now prompts to create constitution if none exists (Y/n default yes)
- `init` command now prompts to generate worktree setup script if not already present (y/N default no)
- Dark mode support for GitHub Pages documentation site
- `init` command now displays permissions/sandbox configuration status and prompts to configure sandbox if not set up
- `init` command shows recommended full automation setup with cclean post_processor and --dangerously-skip-permissions disclaimer on first run
- Native cclean (claude-clean) library integration as internal dependency for beautiful Claude JSONL output parsing with `--output-style` flag and `output_style` config option
- One-time security notice on first workflow run explaining `--dangerously-skip-permissions` usage with sandbox status; suppress via `AUTOSPEC_SKIP_PERMISSIONS_NOTICE=1`
- `init` command now prompts to add `.autospec/` to `.gitignore` with guidance for shared vs personal repos

### Changed
- `init` constitution prompt now explains it's a one-time setup that defines project coding standards
- `init` agent selection now uses interactive arrow-key navigation with space to toggle (replaces number input)

### Removed
- **BREAKING**: Removed legacy config fields `claude_cmd`, `claude_args`, `custom_claude_cmd` (use `agent_preset` or structured `custom_agent` instead)

## [0.5.0] - 2025-12-18

### Added
- `config set/get/toggle/keys` subcommands for CLI-based configuration management with `--user` and `--project` scope flags
- `--max-retries, -r` flag for `plan`, `tasks`, `constitution`, and `checklist` commands to override config retry limit

### Changed
- Improved internal codebase structure for faster future development and better reliability

### Fixed
- Description propagation in `run -a` now matches `autospec all` behavior (only specify stage receives description)

## [0.4.0] - 2025-12-18

### Added
- GitHub Pages documentation website with architecture overview, internals guide, FAQ, and troubleshooting pages
- `ContextMeta` struct to reduce redundant artifact file reads during phase execution
- `task block` and `task unblock` commands to mark tasks as blocked with documented reasons
- `BlockedReason` field in tasks.yaml to track why tasks are blocked (with validation warnings when missing)
- `risks` section in plan.yaml for documenting implementation risks and mitigation strategies
- Schema validation for YAML artifacts (validates structure, not just existence)
- `notes` field in tasks.yaml for additional task context (max 1000 chars)

### Changed
- CLI commands reorganized into subpackages (`stages/`, `config/`, `util/`, `admin/`, `shared/`) for improved maintainability
- Documentation restructured into feature cards for better presentation
- Custom sidebar styles for improved layout and usability
- Pre-flight validation now distinguishes between missing and invalid artifacts with specific error messages
- Retry state resets automatically when starting the specify stage

### Fixed
- Retry context instructions now dynamically injected only during retries (reduces token waste on first-run executions)
- Improved artifact validation shows both missing and invalid files in error output

## [0.3.2] - 2025-12-17

### Added
- `sauce` command to display the project source URL

### Changed
- Installer shows download progress bar for better visibility
- Default installation directory changed to `~/.local/bin`
- Installer now backs up existing binary before upgrading

### Fixed
- Improved installer reliability with better error handling and temp file cleanup
- Fixed POSIX compatibility issues in installer color output

## [0.3.1] - 2025-12-16

### Added
- ASCII art logo in installer
