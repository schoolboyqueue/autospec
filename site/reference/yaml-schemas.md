## Overview

autospec uses YAML-based artifacts for machine-readable output and programmatic access. Each artifact includes a `_meta` section for versioning and validation.

### Artifact Types

| Artifact | File | Description |
|:---------|:-----|:------------|
| spec | `spec.yaml` | Feature specification with requirements |
| plan | `plan.yaml` | Implementation design and architecture |
| tasks | `tasks.yaml` | Task breakdown with dependencies |
| checklist | `checklists/*.yaml` | Quality validation checklists |
| analysis | `analysis.yaml` | Cross-artifact consistency analysis |
| constitution | `constitution.yaml` | Project principles and guidelines |

---

## Common Meta Section

All artifacts include this structure:

```yaml
_meta:
  version: "1.0.0"
  generator: "autospec"
  generator_version: "0.5.0"
  created: "2025-12-13T10:30:00Z"
  artifact_type: "spec"  # spec, plan, tasks, checklist, analysis, constitution
```

---

## spec.yaml

Feature specification with requirements and user stories.

### Structure

```yaml
_meta:
  version: "1.0.0"
  generator: "autospec"
  artifact_type: "spec"
  created: "2025-12-13T10:30:00Z"

  status: "Draft"  # Draft | Completed
  created: "2025-12-13"
  input: "Original feature description"
  completed_at: "2025-12-16T14:30:00Z"  # Set when status is Completed

user_stories:
  - id: "US-001"
    title: "User Login"
    as_a: "registered user"
    i_want: "to log in with my credentials"
    so_that: "I can access my account"
    priority: "P1"  # P1, P2, P3
    why_this_priority: "Core functionality required for all features"
    independent_test: "User can log in with valid credentials"
    acceptance_scenarios:
      - given: "valid credentials"
        when: "user submits login form"
        then: "user is authenticated and redirected to dashboard"

requirements:
  functional:
    - id: "FR-001"
      description: "System MUST validate user credentials against database"
      testable: true
      acceptance_criteria: "Login succeeds with valid email/password"
  non_functional:
    - id: "NFR-001"
      category: "performance"
      description: "Login response time MUST be under 500ms"
      measurable_target: "p95 latency < 500ms"

constraints:
  - "Must integrate with existing session management"
  - "OAuth providers: Google, GitHub only"

assumptions:
  - "Users have verified email addresses"
  - "Password requirements follow OWASP guidelines"

key_entities:
  - name: "User"
    description: "Registered application user"
    attributes:
      - "email"
      - "password_hash"
      - "created_at"

out_of_scope:
  - "Two-factor authentication"
  - "Social login besides Google/GitHub"

edge_cases:
  - scenario: "User enters wrong password 5 times"
    expected_behavior: "Account locked for 15 minutes"

success_criteria:
  measurable_outcomes:
    - id: "SC-001"
      description: "Users can authenticate successfully"
      metric: "Login success rate"
      target: ">99% for valid credentials"
```

### Status Values

| Status | Description |
|:-------|:------------|
| `Draft` | Initial state when spec is created |
| `Completed` | Set automatically when all tasks finish |

When implementation completes, autospec updates `status` to `Completed` and adds `completed_at` timestamp.

## Validation

### Schema Validation

Validate artifacts against their schemas:

```bash
# Type inferred from filename
autospec artifact specs/001/spec.yaml
autospec artifact specs/001/plan.yaml
autospec artifact specs/001/tasks.yaml

# Explicit type (required for checklists)
autospec artifact checklist specs/001/checklists/security.yaml
```

**Validates:**
- Valid YAML syntax
- Required fields present
- Field types correct
- Enum values valid
- Cross-references valid (e.g., task dependencies)

### Syntax-Only Validation

Quick syntax check without schema validation:

```bash
autospec yaml check <file>
```

---

## Querying Artifacts

Use standard YAML tools:

```bash
# Get all user story IDs
yq '.user_stories[].id' spec.yaml

# Get pending tasks
yq '.phases[].tasks[] | select(.status == "Pending")' tasks.yaml

# Count tasks by phase
yq '.phases[] | .number as $n | .tasks | length | "\($n): \(.)"' tasks.yaml

# Get high-impact risks
yq '.risks[] | select(.impact == "high")' plan.yaml
```

---

## Troubleshooting

### Common Validation Errors

| Error | Cause | Fix |
|:------|:------|:----|
| Missing required field | Field not present | Add the field |
| Invalid enum value | Value not in allowed list | Use valid value |
| Invalid type | Wrong data type | Check expected type |
| Invalid reference | Task dependency doesn't exist | Fix task ID |

### YAML Syntax Issues

| Issue | Example | Fix |
|:------|:--------|:----|
| Tabs | `\t` characters | Use spaces |
| Unquoted special chars | `description: foo: bar` | Quote the string |
| Wrong indentation | Inconsistent spaces | Use 2-space indent |

Run `autospec yaml check <file>` for syntax errors with line numbers.
